      <p class="sports-talk col-12 col-md-6 col-xxl-6 d-block">The Sixers
        organization
        appears to
        have survived
        a
        watershed decision for the franchise and
        their MVP, <em>Joel Embiid</em>. James Harden choosing to opt into his last year and seek a trade is the
        best
        thing that
        has happened to the organization since he was traded for Ben Simmons. While the Sixers may be down a body
        going
        into next season, the team has been injected with some good ole` fashioned hope, and that may be the
        prescription
        that helps fans forget about the disappointing early playoff exits that has haunted the franchise since A.I.

    <div class="row justify-content-md-center second_row">
      <p class="Morey col-12 col-md-6 col-xxl-6 d-block">Darryl Morey, once again, has the
        daunting task to find
        a deal that
        allows the Sixers to remain competitive, while having to unload a player whose best days are far behind him.
        Morey,
        whose greatest acquisition was trading for Harden, not once, but twice, will now have to trade away the star
        that
        fueled his meteroic rise in the NBA. There is one person on Morey's list that will make
        all Philadelphia fans lose their minds, if Morey can reel in the big fish, and keep Tyrese Maxey out of the
        trade.</p>

    <div class="row justify-content-md-center third_row">
      <p class="Dame col-12 col-md-6 col-xxl-6 d-block">Dame Lilliard, the unquestionable prize of 2023, is officially
        available to 29 NBA teams. After years of "will he, won't he", he has officially asked for a trade. The price to
        acquire Dame is at a record low due to the new strict, financially destroying, collective bargaining agreement,
        that the NBA and the player's union agreed to earlier this year. It's not all good news for the Sixers however,
        reportedly the Sixers are not on Dame's ultra-short list of preferred teams. It's unfathomable that Morey will
        be put off by Dame's initial cold shoulder. It took years to convince Dame to just ask for a trade, I'm pretty
        sure Darryl is ready to go all-in to convince him that Philadelphia is the only place for him. The big question
        on all 76ers fans minds; is it possible to aquire a player of Dame's status without including Maxey in the
        trade? If Morey is able to pull off a Lillard trade, and somehow is able to keep Maxey in the fold, Morey will
        become a 76ers legend in Philadelphia.</p>
