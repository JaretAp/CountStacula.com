          full
          swing.
          Players, general
          managers, and owners have dug their trenches, positioned themselves in their fox-holes, and are poised to win
          this
          intense game of attrition. The core players in this stare-down comprise four pivotal NBA teams and two marquee
          players. Any other organization, in this arena, serves merely as a facilitator to help seal a deal, or, in an
          unfavorable scenario, acts as a pawn used for leverage against the two teams earnestly seeking to acquire
          these star
          players.

        <p class="portland col-10 col-sm-8 col-md-7 col-lg-6 mx-0 py-2"> Although the Bulls or Knicks could stir the
          pot, the real
          puppeteers of
          this
          summer are the Trailblazers, Heat, Sixers, and Clippers. The Trailblazers possess the power to determine the
          endgame
          of this summer standoff, simply because they have Dame Lillard. The NBA has been biding its time for years,
          waiting
          for him to ask for a trade; a few more months will hardly matter now that he has officially made his request.
          While
          the Trailblazers don't hold every card, they certainly have the winning hand. Their star player is on a
          long-term
          contract, and as long as Dame doesn't threaten to sit out the regular season, their position remains solid.
          The new
          Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), which poses financial constraints and hinders a team's flexibility, is
          the
          only dent in their armor, lowering Dame's market value.

          this
          staredown.
          Dame has made
          it
          clear he wants to play there. However, Miami lacks the enticing assets to make this deal a slam dunk. Their
          draft
          picks are middling at best, and their best tradeable player, despite being talented, is arguably overpaid.
          With the
          new CBA, taking on his $30M a year contract is far from desirable for any team.

        <p class="sixers col-10 col-sm-8 col-md-7 col-lg-6 mx-0 py-2"> The Sixers are in a peculiar spot this summer.
          Despite
          their
          interest in
          Dame,
          Lillard has been explicitly partial to Miami. They have James Harden who is seeking a trade, but teams are
          cautious,
          questioning his desire, commitment, playoff mentality, his hefty contract, and the cost of acquiring him.
          Daryl
          Morey, however, has shown adeptness in managing uncomfortable situations. With Tobias Harris and Maxey in the
          mix,
          Morey certainly has a full plate this summer.

        <p class="clippers col-10 col-sm-8 col-md-7 col-lg-6 py-2 mx-0"> The Clippers also hold significant cards since
          Harden has
          expressed his
          preference to play for them. Similar to Miami, they see no reason to overpay for his services, especially
          given
          Harden's market value. With Jerry West on board, they are known to make astute deals. They are the ones who
          decide
          when Harden is traded since they have the assets that could tip Morey's scales in favor of a 'yes.'

          willing to go to speed up proceedings? Is he willing to cause a media storm, to become the villain in this
          story?
          The NBA is full of such precedents. He can always turn to James Harden for advice...

          Despite having a good rapport with the Sixers, his teammates, and Morey, his previous acts of rebellion might
          hint

          As with most summer trades, things slow down shortly after free agency kicks off. This summer should be no
          different. All four teams have sound reasons to avoid impulsive, overpriced deals. Only Miami stands to lose
          by not
          finalizing a deal before the season's start. The only sparks that could ignite rapid action are the players
          themselves, but are they willing to play with fire? The NBA certainly becomes more thrilling when they do. So,
          when
          can we expect the summer stare-down to finally reach its crescendo? Media Day, a date synonymous with deadline
          day,
          often forces teams into making a decision. Between reporter inquiries, players getting mic-time, and
          franchises
          fretting about team morale, Media Day has historically been the catalyst for many a trade deal.
